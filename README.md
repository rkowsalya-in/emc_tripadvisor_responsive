TripAdvisor Clone

📖 Overview

Welcome to the TripAdvisor Clone project! This is a static website that emulates the look and feel of TripAdvisor’s homepage. Built with HTML, CSS, and media queries, this project demonstrates my skills in front-end web development and responsive design. The aim was to recreate a functional and visually appealing version of TripAdvisor’s homepage with a focus on user experience across different devices.
